# Booting

## BIOS

Simple legagy way to boot but the catch is you need to do a lot of initalisation with limited memory.
for BIOS you need to preapre a 512 bytes flat binary and load your kernel or further bootloader from there

## UEFI

It provides some simple abstractions for modern hardware and fetches the required data for you such as Memory maps etc
